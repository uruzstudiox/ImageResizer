## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
- **Why am I receiving a security warning?**  
This is because the program is unsigned. It is safe to use, and you can bypass
the warning by selecting the "Run Anyway" option. For further details, you can
review the `resizer.py` file in the `raw` folder of the project or refer to 
the documentation in the `docs` folder.
